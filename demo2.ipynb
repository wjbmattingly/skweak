Five days earlier, the Federal Reserve granted GMAC bank holding company status so it could get access to the bailout money. Merkin has also been sued in U.S. District Court in Manhattan for his management of Ascot Partners LLP, a fund he founded that lost an estimated $1.8 billion with Madoff. Madoff, 70, was arrested on December 11 and charged with securities fraud. He is under house arrest in his Manhattan apartment on $10 million bail. On Monday, U.S. prosecutors sought to jail him, saying he had mailed jewelry and other valuables to family and friends in violation of a court order freezing all his belongings.
